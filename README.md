============================

Simplified Google Maps is a very unique plugin, it will allow you to easily create, administrate and customize maps at the WordPress site. Most Google Maps WordPress plugins require that you should master some advanced web development skills. But not anymore! I have created a plugin that handles all the hard work for you, so that you can focus on the end result.

The Simplified Google Maps plugin allow user easily to:

Configure the map settings ( map center, map zoom, map size and map type)
Easily add multiple places on map
Move places on map by drag and drop
Add place detail rich content.
Focus map on any location by simply searching the desired address
And yes ... No coding skills required! It's just works!
